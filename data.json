Law Enforcement Procedure\n   1. All offenses included within the Criminal Code shall be subject to handling and punishment by the Ethics Committee. An action by the Ethics Committee does not prelude a further punishment within the offender's departments.\n   2. All departments of a person punished by the Ethics Committee are required to comply with such a punishment. For example, in the case of a Class E suspension, all command teams of which the offender is a member shall use reasonable efforts to prevent the offender from using that department's team or other privileges on site.\n   3. In the case of conduct in violation of the Code of Ethics without inclusion within the Criminal Code, the Criminal Review Board shall abstain from the case and forward it to the command of the department that the offender is a member of and that is relevant to the nature of the offense. The compliance of departments with the Code of Ethics is subject to review by the Judicial Review Board.\n   4. The Internal Security Service may act pursuant to the Internal Security Policy without regard to the Criminal Code or the Code of Ethics. The Internal Security Policy is subject to review by the O5 Council.\n2. Punishment Procedure - The purpose of this declaration is to regulate the execution of punishments that may be issued by the Ethics Committee.\n   1. When a Formal Warning is issued, a notice shall be sent to the subject explaining the illegality of their conduct.\n   2. When a Class E Sentence is issued:\n      1. a notice shall be sent to the subject explaining the illegality of their conduct and their punishment;\n      2. the subject shall be ranked to \"Suspended Personnel\" in the primary foundation group; and\n      3. the subject's access to all departments teams shall be restricted. Department command teams shall make a reasonable effort to do so after being instructed to by the Ethics Committee.\n   3. When a Foundation Dismissal is issued:\n      1. a notice shall be sent to the subject explaining the illegality of their conduct and their punishment;\n      2. the subject shall be ranked to \"Class D\" in the primary foundation group;\n      3. the subject shall be removed from all departments. Department command teams shall do so after being instructed to by the Ethics Committee; and\n      4. the subject shall be blocked from sending Security Class applications for two months.\n   4. When a Foundation Exile is issued:\n      1. a notice shall be sent to the subject explaining the illegality of their conduct and their punishment;\n      2. the subject shall be ranked to \"Class D\" in the primary foundation group;\n      3. the subject shall be removed from all departments. Department command teams shall do so after being instructed to by the Ethics Committee; and\n      4. the subject shall be blocked from sending Security Class applications for an indefinite amount of time.\n   5. When a Foundation Blacklist is issued:\n      1. a notice shall be sent to the subject explaining the illegality of their conduct and their punishment;\n      2. the subject shall be ranked to \"Class D\" or exiled from the primary foundation group;\n      3. the subject shall be removed from all departments. Department command teams shall do so after being instructed to by the Ethics Committee;\n      4. the subject shall be blocked from sending Security Class applications for an indefinite amount of time;\n      5. the subject shall be removed from all communication servers owned by Pathos; and\n      6. the subject shall be removed from all games and experiences owned by Pathos.\n3. Retroactivity of the law - In the case of law modifications that are done during or momentarily after the processing of an offense, the most lenient version of the law in regards to sentencing shall be used.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. This decision has been decided on by the Judicial Review Board in accordance with rules 2(d) and 3 under subarticle 3(e) of the Board Procedure as follows:\n   1. Approved by the Board Chairman, not contested.",

SoroLover123, Magistrate.\n\n### Case\n\n1. Case [24-005-10-O852/01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1drh73sZmi1wosJod_hJ9mX4kqfNEFXGwYRrj2iT_DLQ/edit?usp=sharing \"‌\") from 25th February, 2024. The sentence was an 18-day Class-E sentence. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Driving without a License as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 3(a); Class C Misdemeanor\n   2. Trespassing into General Areas as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 6(a) clause v.; Class C Misdemeanor\n   3. Trespassing into Containment Areas as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 6(b) clause iii.; Class B Misdemeanor\n   4. Improper Interactions with Hostiles as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 10(b); Class C Misdemeanor\n   5. Failure to Comply as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 9(a); Class B Misdemeanor\n   6. Obstruction of Justice as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 5 § 4(a) clause i.; Class A Misdemeanor\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Did the Criminal Review board reasonably use it’s discretion in the issuing of an 18 day long sentence, considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case report?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. Yes. The case report presents the offender's continuous disrespect of present law enforcement authorities and it clearly demonstrates the suspect's contempt of the foundation law enforcement and justice system. Using established provisions from the case of [https://trello.com/c/CKrGOFpe](https://trello.com/c/CKrGOFpe \"smartCard-inline\") , the board considers the aggravating circumstance as provided by part b., clause iv. of conclusion of law 2 in that case. Furthermore, the board considers the interest of crime deterrence by rehabilitation, as provided by part c., clause iii. in the same case. With the specified factors and circumstances considered, the board believes that there's a clear need for an increased sentence, justifying a 18 day Class E suspension. For the record, the applicable punishment range was a Class E suspension of 6 - 22 days.\n   **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order (passed)**\n\nIn light of the conclusion of law, the board upholds the contested action.\n\n**Vote**\n_AkayaAstraea’s voting rights were recognized in place of cjk04._\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 6 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full majority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2.

Case [T-23-0009](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ayP5KkdW9XLUcyNzUYsrH0-G4vEDi-lDrHu0HBlCDaQ/edit \"‌\") from 4th February 2024. The sentence was a traffic warning. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Careless Driving, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, Section 3 § 1(b); Class B traffic infraction\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Does the Foundation Code, title II., subsections 3 § 1(a) and (b), define driving in the prescribed manner as criminal even if there are no other vehicles or pedestrians nearby that could be affected by such conduct?\n2. Is driving backwards careless driving, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 1(b)?\n   1. If not, could the petitioner instead be charged with Reckless Driving, as provided by title II of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 1(a)?\n      1. Does driving backwards show willful disregard for the safety of others?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. Yes. Allowing traffic misconduct even when it technically affects no one would be out of place compared to other parts of the Criminal Code and would make it unreasonably harder for traffic authorities to properly maintain the safe and efficient flow of traffic. **(PASSED)**\n2. No. As long as the driver is driving the correct way, pursuant to all traffic regulations provided by the traffic code, the driver is not guilty of careless driving. However, driving backwards constitutes reckless driving as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 1(a), as driving backwards is needlessly dangerous, and shows a willful disregard of others safety. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law, the board finds the defendant not guilty of careless driving as provided by the Foundation Code, title II., subsection 3 § 1(b). The board finds the defendant guilty of reckless driving as provided by the Foundation Code, title II., subsection 3 § 1(a) instead. The board sends the case back to the Military Police to issue a new punishment in accordance with the changes in charges. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 7 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2.

    "desc": "### Information\n\n- **Petitioner’s ROBLOX Username:** Good_Minea\n- **Petitioner’s ROBLOX ID:** 2336436547\n- **Entity:** Ethics Committee Trial Court\n- **Type:**  Civil Appellate Order\n- **Reference Number:** AR-18:502-24\n- **Handling Officer:** SoroLover123, Magistrate\n\n### Case\n\n1. Civil case [CV-43:402-24](https://discord.com/channels/827330371912859688/1207848400402255972 \"‌\"), Good_Minea v. BornToKill670, from 16th February 2024. The court ruled in favor of the defendant, dismissing the claims with prejudice and awarding no damages. The plaintiff alleged the following cause of action:\n   1. Assault as provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure, section 2 § 2(a), clause iii.; sought relief of 150 credits\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Does a person assume the risk of injury or death solely by going past the red line in the shooting range?\n2. If the answer to question 1 is no, does a person assume the risk of injury or death by going past the red line in the shooting range in front of an empty shooting range booth and then failing to move away from that booth once it is occupied as long as they had reasonable amount of time to move after reasonable efforts were made to inform the person of the fact that the booth is now occupied?\n3. If the answer to question 1 is no, does a person assume the risk of injury or death by going past the red line in the shooting range in front of an occupied shooting range booth?\n4. If the answer to question 3 is no, does a person assume the risk of injury or death by going past the red line in the shooting range in front of an occupied shooting range booth that is clearly being actively used and shot from?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. No. The purpose of the civil process is to establish an environment where personnel don't unnecessarily inconvenience each other. The board is of the belief that while proper shooting range users should have a degree of legal protection, allowing them to purposefully target other foundation members solely for going over the red line would only cause additional unnecessary inconvenience to others, and it would also be unreasonable of such a person to assume that they will be injured or killed by going into the shooting range when they are not directly interfering with a proper shooting range user.\n   **(PASSED)**\n2. Yes. The shooting range should be used for its purpose. While one does not assume the risk of injury or death solely by going over the red line, it is important to protect proper shooting range users from civil liability for using the range. A person who obstructs the use of the shooting range or its booth, even when the booth was empty when they went in front of it, does clearly assume the risk of injury or death.\n   **(PASSED)**\n3. Yes. By going in front of a shooting range booth that is occupied and so being used, such a person clearly assumes the risk of injury or death.\n   **(PASSED)**\n4. The answer to question 3 is not no.\n\n**Order (passed)**\n\nIn light of the new conclusions of law, the board upholds the contested action.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 7 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. cjk04 - Aye\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye\n2. The Judicial Review Board decided on the second conclusion of law in accordance with rule 7 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. cjk04 - Aye\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye\n3.

Case [24-005-10-V740/01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/172ODjuc5DYGRS0awdtdM_fxwndwfSNr3z9b7sAAKwMg/edit \"‌\") from 7th March 2024. The sentence was a formal warning. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Improper usage of firearms, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, chapter 3 § 7(a); Class B Misdemeanor\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Is there a reasonable doubt that the defendant is the person in the video showing the person firing at a VIP?\n   1. The avatar matches.\n   2. The petitioner could be interpreted to be confessing in the second piece of evidence where they claim “I was possessed and shouldn’t be held liable”.\n   3. The defendant statement is “The video evidence presented does not definitively show my character executing the action in question. I would like to highlight the absence of any reasonable motive or backstory that would link me to the intent of harming a VIP. A motive is a critical element in validating any accusation of this nature. During the interrogation, I made a facetious comment about being 'possessed' to underscore the absurdity of the situation, as I was confident of my non-involvement. This was a humorous defense mechanism, not an admission of guilt, and should be considered in the light of jest. Given the indistinct visual evidence and the lack of motive, it seems clear that the charges against me are founded on a misinterpretation of evidence and comments made in jest.”\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Findings of Fact (passed)**\n\nYes. The board finds that the evidence provided, whilst may heavily suggest guilt by the petitioner, it does not show clear evidence that would prove beyond reasonable doubt that the petitioner is guilty.\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the new finding of fact, the board finds the defendant not guilty of improper usage of firearms as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 7(a).\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the finding of fact and on the order in accordance with rule 5 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (magistrate’s decision):\n   1. Approved by Magistrate Winter_Selection, not contested.",

The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Soliciting and Receiving Assistance with Certain Content as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 5 § 2(e);  Class A Misdemeanor\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Does title II. of the Foundation Code, section 2 § 5(c), rule out the defendant’s criminal liability for soliciting and receiving assistance with a security class application?\n   1. The petitioner argues that while they’ve read the respective documentation carefully, they still didn’t understand that such conduct is not allowed.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law (passed)**\n\n1. No. The clause specifically states that '“Reasonably believed” shall not include situations caused by failure to properly read any documentation or law'. The board is of the opinion that “failure to properly read any documentation or law” extends to failure to properly understand any documentation or law, making this clause not applicable in this case.\n\n**Order (passed)**\n\nIn light of the conclusion of law, the board upholds the decision.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the conclusion of law in accordance with rule 6 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full majority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2.

Case [24-005-10-D793](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19K8CHdgItFINrVF79M8LVVggpGonVdB9Tx2nV4W7CRE/edit?usp=sharing \"‌\") from 9th February 2024. The sentence was a 3 day Class E sentence. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Failing to comply with an installation protocol as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 2(a); Class C Misdemeanor\n   2. Unlawful discharge of a firearm as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 7(b); Class B Misdemeanor\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Does title II. of the Foundation Code, section 2 § 5(d), rule out the defendant’s criminal liability for their decision to leave Site Phi and attempt to return to Site Epsilon when they were ordered to do so by their test escorts, a Security Department Agent and a Crimson-9 task force Agent?\n2. Is there a reasonable doubt that the petitioner assumed the Military Police member was a Class-D?\n   1. It was Protocol Uproar during the commission of the crime.\n3. If the answer to point 2 is yes, was it reasonable of the defendant to act upon that assumption and shoot at the Military Police member?\n4. If the answers to points 2 and 3 is yes, does that absolve the defendant of criminal liability for firing at the Military Police officer in accordance with title II. of the Foundation Code, section 2 § 5(e)?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. In regards to point 1, the answer is yes. The Crimon-9 task force Agent, especially considering his role as the defendant's test escort and as a seasoned combative, is a person of authority as provided by the referenced criminal liability exception clause. **(PASSED)**\n2. The answer to points 2 and 3 is not yes.\n\n**Findings of Fact**\n\n1. The answer to point 2 is yes. - **(PASSED)**\n2. No. Firearm holders must be held to a higher standard, especially during such emergency situations. The defendant's use of the firearm in this situation was reckless. It is everyone's responsibility to take reasonable efforts to check what or who they're shooting at. The defendant did not take any such reasonable efforts. - **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law, the board finds the defendant not guilty of failing to comply with an installation protocol as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 2(a). The board upholds the Criminal Review Board's decision to find the defendant guilty of unlawful discharge of a firearm as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 7(b). The board sends the case back to the Criminal Review Board to issue a new punishment in accordance with the changes in charges. The board also asks the Criminal Review Board to consider the fact that the offense was committed recklessly, not knowingly or purposefully in their sentencing. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 6 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full majority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. JaroCycle - Absent\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye\n2.

Case [24-005-10-D390](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yWWE27B9NKk5GRdm2DgaEXRdkfNel2XRldA0WN4oGqc/edit \"‌\") from 7th February 2024. The sentence was a 5 day Class E suspension. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Failure to Comply as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 9(a); Class B Misdemeanor\n   2. Causing a Public Disturbance as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 2(c); Class C Misdemeanor\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Is the CRB's discretion in sentencing absolute as long as it is used consistently and in accordance with the Foundation Code?\n2. If the answer to point 1 is no, what are the mitigating and aggravating circumstances that should be considered when deciding the sentence, and what should be the sentence if there is absence of any such circumstances?\n   1. Does the treatment of a person(s) under detainment affect the severity of the sentence the Criminal Review Board should issue?\n      1. Were the following efforts, or the lack thereof, taken by the law enforcement authorities unreasonable?\n         1. Being killed by Military Police, after the petitioner refused to get off the road.\n         2. Being left sitting in a chair, cuffed, so that any Foundation Personnel could spectate the interrogation.\n         3. Not taking required precautions to prevent the petitioner from being killed by Class-D personnel.\n         4. Being teleported back to the Ethics Committee interrogation room via in-game admin commands.\n            1. If so, is a sentence reduction to a 2 day Class E sentence reasonable?\n3. Was the Criminal Review Board's decision in sentencing correct?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. In regards to point 1, the answer is no. The Criminal Review Board's decisions on sentencing, which albeit may be legal and consistent, shall be subject to review by the Judicial Review Board if an appellate order is created. The Judicial Review Board serves as an appellate entity, a forum for those subject to an action to find justice in the case against them. In an effort to maintain a consistent criminal and justice system, the Judicial Review Board must, as the only and final appellate entity, maintain appellate jurisdiction over the Criminal Review Board's discretion in sentencing. **(PASSED)**\n2. A judicial authority with the discretion to issue multiple punishments or a punishment of various length shall:\n   1. consider the following as mitigating circumstances:\n      1. the offender confessed to the offense;\n      2. the offender committed the offense negligently;\n      3. the offender committed the offense out of lack of experience or knowledge;\n      4. the offender committed the offense because of poor or wrong understanding of the law;\n      5. the offender committed no criminal offenses before;\n      6. the nature of the offense suggested the applicability of a criminal liability exception without fully meeting its conditions;\n      7. the offender clearly demonstrated remorse and was fully compliant with law enforcement and judicial authorities; and\n   2. consider the following as aggravating circumstances:\n      1. the offender committed the offense purposefully or with premeditation or after previous deliberation;\n      2. the offender abused their power, standing, or position by committing the offense;\n      3. the offender committed the offense as a member of an organized group or conspiracy;\n      4. the offender was disrespectful or demonstrated contempt to law enforcement or judicial authorities or the judicial system in general; and\n   3. may further consider the following factors:\n      1. the extent of the offense, the amount of victims or specific acts, and the duration of the offense’s commission;\n      2. the interest of protecting the community against immoral and unacceptable conduct;\n      3. the interest of crime prevention by deterrence and rehabilitation; and\n      4. the interest of restoring justice, repairing or stopping the harm caused by the crime. **(PASSED)**\n3. The board finds no flaws in the Criminal Review Board's decision. Applying the guidelines from conclusion 1, the board believes that there are two aggravating circumstances to be considered in accordance with clauses i. and iv. of part 2 of that conclusion. Furthermore, the board believes that the interest of crime prevention by rehabilitation must be considered, whereas a lower crime would have a lower chance of sufficiently deterring the defendant from repeating such an offense in the future. The sentencing range is anywhere from a formal warning to a 6 day class E sentence, and so considering the specified circumstances, the board considers a 5 day class E sentence adequate. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law, the board upholds the contested action. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 7 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. JaroCycle - Absent\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye\n2.

The statements included “I clearly was telling the truth about the incident of SCP-914”, “I was held hostage in the SCP-914 chamber”, “once a guard entered the room (hey068) quickly scurried away”, and “I was told that I added hey068 because I “knew him” which I never claimed to have said.” These statements may be found in exhibit C.\n- Firstly, the defendant claims that they were held hostage, and forced to enter the SCP-914 box. However, this is determined to be misleading, and false. The clip provided by the Falcon-2 agent in the relevant Criminal Review Board’s case report, [24-005-10-S127](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pc2wauDRfOJeEMVvJKg_vn8S1aWaKD7sZPsn0JxY4qo/edit \"‌\"), further classified as exhibit A, shows the defendant in the room alone, entering the box on their own volition.\n- Secondly, the defendant claims that they did not know who the Class-D whomst allegedly took them hostage was. This is also determined to be false, as the Class-D was on their friends list, and they quickly unadded them once confronted. This is supported by the present Ethics Committee officer’s testimony and exhibits B.1 and B.2.\n- Thirdly, the defendant claims that the Class-D exited the SCP-914 chamber when the Falcon-2 agent entered. However, this is proven to be false, as there is only one exit to the SCP-914 room, and the Falcon-2 agent was at the exit when the Class-D supposedly exited, as seen in Exhibit A.\n- Exhibit A: [https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/1WGwWv2rzQYDqV/d1337ApPiDWa?invite=cr-MSxNNEMsMzc3NDM5Mjgs](https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/1WGwWv2rzQYDqV/d1337ApPiDWa?invite=cr-MSxNNEMsMzc3NDM5Mjgs \"smartCard-inline\")\n  Exhibit B.1: [https://gyazo.com/644df611988439dc46c9af83a1be64a0](https://gyazo.com/644df611988439dc46c9af83a1be64a0 \"smartCard-inline\")\n  Exhibit B.2: [https://gyazo.com/4d89ca97d3b95a3a2e80c7c86bafca5f](https://gyazo.com/4d89ca97d3b95a3a2e80c7c86bafca5f \"smartCard-inline\")\n  Exhibit C: Ticket records of the Ethics Committee, ticket #2168\n  Investigator’s Testimony:\n  - “During a patrol of the Site Epsilon Medium Containment Zone, the Falcon-2 agent spotted a person in the SCP-914 containment zone. The Falcon-2 entered the chamber, preparing to terminate what he assumed was a Class-D. The Falcon-2 then terminated the defendant, which in the clip, shows the defendant using SCP-914.\n  - The defendant is brought into detainment, and is questioned. The defendant claims they were held hostage by a Class-D by the name of “_hey068”_. The defendant additionally claimed the Class-D forced them to use SCP-914, although this is clearly a lie, as the thermal goggles of the Falcon-2 agent show only one person in the containment chamber, and also clearly shows the defendant activating, and entering SCP-914 by their own will. The investigator quickly looked at the Class-D’s profile, immediately noting that the defendant had the Class-D added. The investigator asks the defendant if they know the Class-D, or have any connection with them, and they decline. The investigator asks again, very clearly, if the defendant knows the Class-D. The defendant goes silent for a moment, and the investigator returns to the Class-D’s profile, noticing that the Class-D had unadded the defendant. This clearly shows that the defendant realized they may get caught, and clearly attempted to hide the fact that they have a connection to the Class-D. The defendant continued to lie about their affiliation with the Class-D, and continued to deny guilt. […]“\n\n### Order (passed)\n\nThe board, by an unanimous decision, orders as follows:\n\n- In respect to count 1, the board concludes that the defendant indeed provided false statements to the board, as further explained and proven in other parts of this Prosecution Order, and so the board finds the defendant guilty of count 1.\n- In respect to the punishment, considering the conclusions and findings, the board sentences the defendant in accordance with the Criminal Code as follows:\n- The offense is classified as a Class A Misdemeanor, further enhanced in accordance with title II. of the Foundation Code, section 2 § 2(e) with the preceding offense being counts 1 and 3 of case 24-005-10-S127, making the offense a second-degree felony, allowing for a Class E suspension for no more than 25 days, a foundation dismissal, or a foundation exile. The board considers the following:\n  1. The defendant has a previous criminal record involving intentionally misleading investigative authorities, which is of a similar nature as the crime they are being charged with. The board considers the interest of crime prevention by rehabilitation, recognizing that a previous 22 day Class E suspension (which was the punishment in the mentioned previous criminal record) did not correct their behavior, in accordance with part (c)(iii) of conclusion of law 2 in the case of d2holder v. Criminal Review Board, case number AR-15:502-24.\n  2. The defendant continues to show contempt of the foundation’s justice system, which is considered an aggravating circumstance in accordance with part (b)(iv) of conclusion of law 2 in the case of d2holder v. Criminal Review Board, case number AR-15:502-24.\n- Considering these circumstances, the board issues a 12 day Class E suspension.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the order in accordance with rule 3 of subarticle 3(d) of the Board Procedure as follows (majority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. Winter_Selection - Aye",

    "desc": "### Information\n\n- **Petitioner’s ROBLOX Username:** Arkolenn\n- **Petitioner’s ROBLOX ID:** 122273953\n- **Entity:** Criminal Review Board\n- **Type:** Appellate Order\n- **Reference Number:** AR-20:602-24\n- **Handling Officer:** Winter_Selection, on behalf of SoroLover123\n\n### Case\n\n1. Case [24-005-10-A122/01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IDQKdqrTTpMN1fqTQ5vH1JtJa6X2_yoQHKxUh9YpDo/edit \"‌\") from 22nd February 2024. The sentence was a 4 day Class-E suspension. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Assisting with Certain Content, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 5 § 2(f).\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Is showing a list of the GOIs on the ROBLOX group page assisting with a Security Class 2 application, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 5 § 2(f)?\n   1. The petitioner argues that it isn’t directly assisting with the application, as they did not directly give them an answer, rather provided the answer in a form of the GOI list.\n      1. Several answers were made available to the person asking for assistance on their Security Class 2 application via the image.\n      2. The application question at hand reads “What is the Department of Diplomatic Affairs responsible for? List at least one affiliated group.”\n   2. The petitioner argues that the answer was vague enough so that even if they did use the answer, they would need to do research on their own.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. The board believes that directly referencing or linking certain content and showing or embedding that content in a picture carries no difference. Reviewing the use of Criminal Review Board's prosecutorial discretion, which must be used consistently, the Criminal Review Board would charge personnel as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 5 § 2(f) for directly referencing or linking such content, and so showing or embedding that content in a picture can be subject to such charges as well. The board wants to put emphasis on the word \"directly\" in the first sentence - for example, linking a webpage with an article that contains the answer could be referencing such content indirectly, while quoting a specific sentence in that article could be referencing such content directly, and so there would be a difference.\n   **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order (passed)**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law and new findings of fact, the board upholds the contested action.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on first concluson of law in accordance with rule 6 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full majority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. cjk04 - Aye\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye\n2.

Case [24-005-10-S302/01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JEBbaLhYh2Wqd5gen1iaP_WVzVq0yV9EP5_qqJOP0w4/edit \"‌\") from 23 February 2024. The sentence was a formal warning. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Trespassing as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 6(a), clause i.; Class C Misdemeanor\n   2. Criminal Interaction with the Pandora Crysta as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 5(a); Class C Misdemeanor\n\n### Petition\n\nThe petition may be found within the ticket records of the Ethics Committee, #2173.\n\n1. The petitioner has committed no other crimes than the case to be expunged, staying clear of any criminal liability for the past week.\n2. The petitioner has maintained an active commitment to the foundation within the last week, being an active member of the Security Department, playing for an hour a day.\n3. The petitioner had no disciplinary issues in the past week since their case.\n4. The petitioner believes the cause of the punishment to be their lack of knowledge of the legislative documents and Pandora range and believes that this was corrected, demonstrated by their progress to Security Agent within the Security Department, and them also stating that they did immediately review the legislative documents after the punishments.\n5. It may seem to have been far too short of a timeframe to effectively and adequately conclude that the petitioner had indeed improved after this crime.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Order**\n\nThe expungement request is denied. The board doesn't believe that the defendant sufficiently demonstrated a change in standards.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the order in accordance with subrule 4(b) of subarticle 3(c) of the Board Procedure, whereas the voting procedure has been adjusted in accordance with rule 8(c) of article 2 of the Board Procedure, as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. JaroCycle - Absent\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye",

If a person has experience on the Security Department team, and they are allowed in the monorails on that team, is it reasonable to say that the person would reasonably believe that they are allowed there on Foundation Personnel, making them not liable, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, chapter 2 § 5(c)?\n2. Did the Criminal Review Board use their discretion correctly in issuing a formal warning based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, provided by d2holder v. Criminal Review Board?\n   1. The petitioner claims that they left the area and complied with combative orders immediately, and as such, they got too severe of a punishment.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. No. There is absolutely no reason to believe that department privileges in general apply off your department team.\n2. Yes. The Criminal Review Board chose the lowest and only applicable punishment in the sentencing for such a conviction.\n\n**Findings of Fact**\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law, the board upholds the contested action.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1.

The case presents the following charges:\n   1. 3 § 8(d) - Improper Interactions with Anomalies, interfering with Containment of an Anomaly\n   2. 5 § 4(i) - Obstruction of Justice\n\n### Petition\n\n1. The petitioner has committed more crimes since the case they are requesting expungement for, with the most recent one being committed in January 2024.\n2. The petitioner has maintained an active commitment to the foundation within the last 2 months, being a semi-active member of the Scientific Department.\n3. The petitioner had no disciplinary issues in their department the past month since their most recent case\n4. The petitioner believes the cause of the punishment to be their lack of knowledge on the rules of the Foundation, as they stated they were quite new and getting used to the rules and believes that this was corrected, demonstrated by their progress within the foundation, achieving the rank of Junior Researcher within the Scientific Department and the rank of Security Class-2.\n5. It should also be noted that a few weeks later, the clause and context of the breaching anomalies crime that the defendant committed was  made lawful.\n6. It seems that the petitioner has committed crimes frequently since this crime as evident by them having several dress code violations and a few failure to comply violations, due to them violating the dress code after being specifically warned to not do so, they have also had an Obstruction of Justice charge.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Order**\n\nThe expungement request is denied. The board doesn't believe that the defendant sufficiently demonstrated a change in standards or character.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1.
